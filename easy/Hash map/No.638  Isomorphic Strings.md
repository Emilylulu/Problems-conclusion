### Description
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.
### Example
Given s = "egg", t = "add", return true.

Given s = "foo", t = "bar", return false.

Given s = "paper", t = "title", return true.

You may assume both s and t have the same length.
