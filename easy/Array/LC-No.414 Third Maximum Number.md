### Description
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the third maximum number in this array. <br>
If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).
### Example
```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```
```
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```
```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```
