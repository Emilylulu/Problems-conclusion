### Description
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

### Example
Example 1:<br>
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. <br>
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. <br>

Example 2:<br>
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]<br>
Output: 1<br>
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. <br>
Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.<br>
