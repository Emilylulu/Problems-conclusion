### Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
### Example
Given binary tree A = {3,9,20,#,#,15,7}, B = {3,#,20,15,7}<br>

The binary tree A is a height-balanced binary tree, but B is not.
