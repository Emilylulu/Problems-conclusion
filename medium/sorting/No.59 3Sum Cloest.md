### Description
Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers.
### Example
For example, given array S = [-1 2 1 -4], and target = 1. The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

### Challenge
O(n^2) time, O(1) extra space
