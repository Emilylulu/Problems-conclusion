### Description
Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.

Return the difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

### Example
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 4.

The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).

Challenge
Do it in O(nlogn) time complexity.
