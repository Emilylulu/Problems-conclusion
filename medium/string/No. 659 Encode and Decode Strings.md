### Description
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

#### Example
Given strs = ["lint","code","love","you"]<br>
string encoded_string = encode(strs)<br>
return ["lint","code","love","you"] when you call decode(encoded_string)
