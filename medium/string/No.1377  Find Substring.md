### Description
Given the length k, find all substrings of length k in the string str.
The characters of a substring can not be repeated and output the number of substrings that satisfy such conditions (the same substring is counted only 1 times).

### Example
Given str = "abc", k = 2, output 2.

Explanation:
Characters are not repeated, and substrings of length k have "ab", "bc".

Given str = "abacb", k = 1, output 3.

Explanation:
Characters are not repeated, and substrings of length k have "a", "b",”c”.

### Notice
|str| <= 100000.
k <= 100000.
All characters are lowercase.
