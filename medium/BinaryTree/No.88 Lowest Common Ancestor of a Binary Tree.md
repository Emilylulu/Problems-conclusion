### Description
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

### Example
Example 1:<br>
	Input:  For the following binary tree（only one node）:<br>
	1<br>
	LCA(1,1) = 1<br>
	
Example 2:<br>
	Input:  For the following binary tree:<br>

  LCA(3, 5) = 4<br>
	LCA(5, 6) = 7<br>
	LCA(6, 7) = 7<br>
### Notice
Assume two nodes are exist in tree.
