### Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.<br>
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.<br>
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.<br>
A single node tree is a BST<br>

### Example
Example 1:<br>
	Input:  For the following binary tree（only one node）:<br>
	-1<br>
	Output：true<br>
	
Example 2:<br>
	Input:  For the following binary tree:<br>
